    "- [ ] Provide examples to the chain using FewShotPromptTemplate or FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate to make sure it always replies with three emojis.\n",
    "- [ ] To check that the memory is working ask the chain about two movies and then in another cell ask the chain to tell you what is the movie you asked about first."
